Rok leyy

Koi umraan da saath nibhaa ke je
Ikk dam hath chadd de
Kithe jaave pher rajkumari je
Raja ohnu dilon kadd de

Kise rani banauna nai
Chahe mainu koi vi mila

Tainu kivein samjhaavan ve
Rok lai ve mainu babulaa*
  Kivein russeya manaavan ve
   Rok lai ve mainu babulaa

Door tujhse hone ki sab dete hain
Mujhko badhai ajj ve
Dekh mehandi wale ne mere haathon pe
Likhdi judaai ajj ve

Chaahe jhootha hi ikk waari
Pichhon waaj maar ke bula

Tainu kivein samjhaawan ve
Rok lai ve mainu babulaa
Tainu kivein samjhaawan ve
Rok lai ve mainu babulaa


Saari umr hasaa ke kyu/yun
Ajj mainu ditta ae rulaa
Kivein russeya manaavan ve
Rok lai ve mainu babulaa

Tha jo apne haathon se sajaaya
Woh ghar jab toot‚Äôta dikhe
Beeta jahaan mera bachpan saara
Woh ghar jab chhoot‚Äôta dikhe


Main naa Kivein  ghabraavan ve
Das kivein rakha haunsla
Tainu kivein samjhaawan ve
Rok lai ve mainu babulaa

Kaise Tumhe Roka Karun
Meri Taraf Aata Har
Gham Phisal Jaaye
Aankhon Mein Tum Ko Bharun
Bin Bole Baatein Tumse Karun
‚ÄòGar Tum Saath Ho

Rok leyy

Koi umraan da saath nibhaa ke je
Ikk dam hath chadd de
Kithe jaave pher rajkumari je
Raja ohnu dilon kadd de

Kise rani banauna nai
Chahe mainu koi vi mila

Tainu kivein samjhaavan ve
Rok lai ve mainu babulaa*
  Kivein russeya manaavan ve
   Rok lai ve mainu babulaa

Door tujhse hone ki sab dete hain
Mujhko badhai ajj ve
Dekh mehandi wale ne mere haathon pe
Likhdi judaai ajj ve

Chaahe jhootha hi ikk waari
Pichhon waaj maar ke bula

Tainu kivein samjhaawan ve
Rok lai ve mainu babulaa
Tainu kivein samjhaawan ve
Rok lai ve mainu babulaa


Saari umr hasaa ke kyu/yun
Ajj mainu ditta ae rulaa
Kivein russeya manaavan ve
Rok lai ve mainu babulaa

Tha jo apne haathon se sajaaya
Woh ghar jab toot‚Äôta dikhe
Beeta jahaan mera bachpan saara
Woh ghar jab chhoot‚Äôta dikhe


Main naa Kivein  ghabraavan ve
Das kivein rakha haunsla
Tainu kivein samjhaawan ve
Rok lai ve mainu babulaa

Lyrics :

 

MUKHDA-

 

Phir na aisi raat aayegi

Yun humein jo saath laayegi

Phir na aisi raat aayegi

Yun humein jo saath laayegi

 

Nazdeek se raat bhar

Dekh loon main tumhe

Jaane na doon iss dafa

Rok loon main tumhe

 

Tum saamne sach mein ho

Ya koi khwaab hai

Khud pe nahin hai yakeen

Poochh loon main tumhe

 

Phir zubaan pe ek martaba

Aaj dil ki baat aayegi

Phir na aisi raat aayegi

Yun humein jo saath laayegi

 

 

ANTARA-

 

Kya ye mumkin hai kabhi

Tum mere ho paaoge

Main ye baahein khol dunga

Tum gale lag jaaoge

 

Jis tarha ummeed se

Dekhta hun main tumhe

Tum mujhe bhi uss nazar se

Dekhne lag jaaoge

 

Ya isi ummeed mein meri

Zindagi guzar jaayegi

 

Phir na aisi raat aayegi

Yun humein jo saath laayegi ..

Nazdeek se raat bhar

Dekh loon main tumhe

Jaane na doon iss dafa

Rok loon main tumhe

Tum saamne sach mein ho

Ya koi khwaab hai

Khud pe nahin hai yakeen

Poochh loon main tumhe

O Munda Ode Te Crazy
She Don't Know She Don't Know
Duniya Jide Te Crazy
She Don't Know She Don't Know
Munda Ode Te Crazy
Haan Din Vichon Tere Lai Time Kadh Ke
Karda Main Promise Milan Aaunga
Mainu Pata Ae Tu Fan Salman Khan Di
Ode Gaane Gaake Tainu Main Sunaunga
Hovaan Date Pe Naa Late
Gal Seedhi Karan Straight

Tune Kiya Kuch Aisa Ki Main Baaki Sab
Ladkiyon Ke Bare Mein Sochna Chhod Raha Hoon
Mana Ki Thoda Busy Hoon
Teri Meri Shaadi Ke Liye Main Paise Jod Raha Hoon
Kabse Karun Tujhko Main Chase Baby
Dil Mein Mujhe Dede Thodi Space Baby
Na Mujhpe Koi Cheating Wala Case Baby
Shareef Hoon Main Dekh Mera Face Baby
Mujh Pe Ab Tera Jaadu Hai
Meri Khushboo Mein Teri Khushboo Hai
Saara Jag Bhul Ab Mere Liye
Miss World Miss Universe Baby Tu Hai
Tere Saath Ghumu Tujhe Duniya Dikhaunga
Na Tujhse Kabhi Door Na Jaunga
Bol To Sahi Dil Khol To Sahi
Aise Bina Bole Jayegi To Pagal Ho Jaunga
Haan

LYRICS OF SUIT 

Now whatever you wear bae 
You can make the whole room stare
But you know that my favourite
Is when you're rocking that desi swag

O tenu Suit Suit Karda
Ni tu lagdi Punjaban
Lagdi patola
Lagge ni tu sareyan to wakh ni
tenu suit suit karda
O tenu Suit Suit Karda
Ni tu lagdi Punjaban
Lagdi patola
Lagge ni tu sareyan to wakh ni
tenu suit suit karda

Jhanjhar de shor ne tabayi jehu payi aa
Pushde ne munde dasso kudi kitho ayi aa
Hai ni bacha phire
Hai ni bacha phire
Phire bacha bacha tere utte marda
Tenu suit suit karda

Ooh your little black dress, it don‚Äôt do it for me
You know how to impress, just give it to me
No jeans no dresses no tees no 
My queen she's in a saree yeah 
So keep it desi, like you're in Delhi 
You gotta rep the team shorty 
I know they're flexing but it's me you should be checking 
Cos I wanna make you my rani, rock with me

Black, yellow , red jado paake ni tu nikle
Mundeyan de sceneyan cho ‚Ä™dil odo fisle
Kehno dil wali gal
Kehno dil wali gal
Dil wali gal kehno guru darda

Tenu suit suit karda
O tenu suit suit karda

The film is written by Luv Ranjan, Aseem Arrora & Zeishan Quadri, it is directed by Hansal Mehta, produced by Ajay Devgn, Luv Ranjan & Ankur Garg, and presented by Bhushan Kumar.  

Chhalaang is a hilarious, yet inspirational journey of a PT Master from a semi government funded school in Northern India. Montu (Rajkummar Rao) is a typical PT Master for whom it‚Äôs just a job. When circumstances put everything that Montu cares for at stake, including Neelu (Nushrratt Bharuccha) who he loves, Montu is forced to do what he has never done - Teach. Through Montu‚Äôs journey, Chhalaang humorously addresses the value of Sports Education in the school curriculum.

Lyrics :- 
O Munda Downtown launda geriyan
Thodi jehi peeke 
Set jeha hoke 
Gallan kare teriyan 

O Munda Downtown launda geriyan
O Munda Downtown launda geriyan

Range Rover nu len di 
Mitran di Range aa
Goreyan de layi baby 
Eh gal badi strange aa 

Jattan da aa munda
Desi jeha munda 
Baharle mulk ch leaonda nehriyan
O Munda Downtown launda geriyan

Seeshe down karke 
Patole Rehnda takda 
Ho gya mariz munda 
Billi teri akh da

Akhan nu mila ke
Dil jeha laake

Guru na kare Hera pheriyan

O Munda Downtown launda geriyan
O Munda Downtown launda geriyan

LYRICS
Nachh Punjabban

Jitne Bhi Nach de ne saare
Koi naiyo there Jaisa lagda 
Gir gaye aasman se taare 
Na Bindiya Tu aise Chamka 

Ji kalle kalle rehna mainu Achha lagda 
Jo Bhi Tu kahe saara mainu jhootha lagda 
Na mere jaisa mileya Caribbean to Kutch 

Aa angrejji music mein
De de tu punjabi touch

Nachh Punjabban

Nachh Punjabban

O Aja sajke ajaa
O aja kamar hila ajaa
O sarey mood jamaa jaa
Mausam tajaa taajaa

Sari duniya me ji
Hit hain Punjaabi sach

Nachh Punjabban

Nachh Punjabban

Lagga le ji kalla tikka
Nazar na tainu laagey
Soda soda rang yeh tera
Marjavaa gur khaakey 

Tu jo nachchey sarey tainu
Dekhkhe ji paglakey
Paga Paga Paga Pagalakey 

Je tu nachhey hove
Dhamaka ji Too much.. Nach..

Nachh Punjabban

Nachh Punjabban

O Aja sajke ajaa
O aja kamar hila ajaa
O sarey mood jamaa jaa
Mausam tajaa taajaa

Sari duniya me ji
Hit hain Punjaabi sach..

Nachh Punjabban

Nachh Punjabban

Nache Nache Nache Nache

Nachh Punjabban

Nache Nache Nache Nache

Dekh teri chal Meri Jaan jandiye 
Khil jaye Dil tu jo paas aandiye (2)

Nachh Punjabban

Nachh Punjabban

O meri raani zara sun meri baat
Chal aja beat pe nache ek saath
Teri meri jodi lagdi ey too much
Dhai tera dhai mera
Hogaya ji paanch

Kinni var kinni var
Keinda me
Tu nachey to door na reinda me
Tere tey tere tey tere tey
Dil yeh lagda ve

Chuunni lade ve duey lappe waali
Ve choudey lappe wali
Ve hun mera naiyo sarda
Chunni ledu ve duey lappe waali
Ni chaudey lappe waali
Ni ba pass kar lainey de

Peechey tere yaar khada
Na kabhi naiyo tu ghabra
Fikar karaa teri kudiya
Apni fikar naiyo yaar zara
Jhooti jhooti baatey naiyo yaar karaa
Sachj sachi aja mainu pyaar karaa
Ban jau teri me deeewani ekbaari tu jo mere liye doli laadey

Chuunni lade ve duey lappe waali
Ve choudey lappe wali
Ve hun mera naiyo sarda
Chunni ledu ve duey lappe waali
Ni chaudey lappe waali
Ni ba pass kar lainey de

Chunni laidu aja ve nakhre wali
Me kardu duniya saari
Ek tere naal dil yeh jachda

:::::::::::::Lyrics: Teri Yaari::::::::::::
Are Nahi Aayenge Vo Lafange
Kyun Unke Chakkar Mein Apni 
Shaadi Kharab Kar Raha Hai
Chal Aa Shuru Karte Hain
Chalo Bahi
Lagao Koi Gaana Vaana

Tu Mera Bhai Hai
Mera Yaar Hai
Aur Jiske Paas Sacha Yaar Hai Uske Pass Sara Sansaar Hai 
Ve Main Jinni Vaari Duniya Te Aawan 
Tere Warga Yaar Hi Pawaan
Ve Main Jinni Vaari Duniya Te Aawan 
Tere Warga Yaar Hi Pawaan
Mera Bhai Mera Yaar Meri Jaan Tu
Tere Pichein Kisi To Bhi Lad Jaavan
Bas Tu Hi Mera Yaar Bas Tu Hi Mera Pyar
